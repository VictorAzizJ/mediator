Like, is there another way that we can, like, make this work? Like, is there something that you can think of? You know, if I can't do it tonight, can we maybe do it the next day? I mean, what are your thoughts?\nSpeaker A: I mean, I guess tomorrow morning will be okay. I guess we could talk about it in the morning.\nSpeaker B: That would be great.\nSpeaker A: You have time?\nSpeaker B: Yeah. Yeah, I have time. Yeah. We can do it over breakfast.\nSpeaker A: Okay. Okay. I can do that. I can do that. I mean, I get. I get that you had a hard day. Yeah. That would mean a lot if we could talk about it at breakfast.\nSpeaker B: Perfect.
